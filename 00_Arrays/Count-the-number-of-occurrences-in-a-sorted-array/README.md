Time Complexity: O(Logn)

Programming Paradigm: Divide & Conquer

## Solution
  
  1. Use Binary search to get index of the first occurrence of x in arr[]. Let the index of the first occurrence be i.
  2. Use Binary search to get index of the last occurrence of x in arr[]. Let the index of the last occurrence be j.
  3. Return (j â€“ i + 1

## NOTE

```
Instead of mid=(hi+lo)/2

Write, mid=lo+(hi-lo)/2
