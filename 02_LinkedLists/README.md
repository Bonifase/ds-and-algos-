# LinkedLists
1. Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
    * FOLLOW UP, How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
2. Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
3. Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
   * EXAMPLE
     * Input: the node `c` from the linked list `a->b->c->d->e`
     * Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like `a->b->d->e`
4. Write code to partition a linked list around a value `x`, such that all nodes less than `x` come before all nodes greater than or equal to `x`.
5. You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.**[add-two-numbers](add-two-numbers)**
6. Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.**[LoopInList](LoopInList)**
   * DEFINITION
     * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer  points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
   * EXAMPLE
     * input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
     * output: C
7. Implement a function to check if linkedlist is a palindrome. **[isPalindrome](isPalindrome)**
8. Write a function to remove a single occurrence of an integer from a doubly linked list if it is present. **[doubleLinkDel](doubleLinkDel)**
9. Delete the Node at a Particular Position in a Linked List. **[delAtPosition](delAtPosition)**
10. Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. **[merge-two-sorted-lists](merge-two-sorted-lists)**
11. Reverse a singly linked list. **[reverse-linked-list](reverse-linked-list)**
12. Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. **[merge-k-sorted-lists](merge-k-sorted-lists)**
