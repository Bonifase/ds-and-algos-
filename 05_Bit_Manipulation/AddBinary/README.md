**Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string)**

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example:

```
Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
]
```

## Solution

Remember the binary addition rules shown below, and remember the carry over in the code during each addition

```
    0 + 0 = 0
    0 + 1 = 1
    1 + 0 = 1
    1 + 1 = 10 
    1 + 1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
```
